## How to play

1.  _Start the Game_: Run `new_test.py` to launch the game.

2.  _Fruit Slicing_: When the fruits start falling, press the key corresponding to the letter on the fruit to slice it.

3.  _Avoid Bombs_: Be carful to avoid bomb, or they will cost you a life.

4.  _Use Power-Ups_: Some fruits will grant power-ups like ice cubes that freeze the screen, allowing you to slice all fruits present during the freeze duration.

5.  _Game Over Sound_: Plays when the game ends.

## Translations

The game supports multiple languages! Translations are stored in the `translation.json` file, which you can update with your own language support.

To change the language, simply update the settings in the _TranslationManager_.
